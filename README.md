# Modelling Data in the Tidyverse Course Project

As part of Coursera - [Modeling data in the Tidyverse](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tidyverse-modelling-data)

When a complaint is submitted by a consumer, the CFPB has to determine which category the complaint falls in (e.g. "Mortgage", "Student loan", etc). In this project, the goal would be to build a classification algorithm to classify consumer complaints into one of four categories: "Credit card or prepaid card", "Mortgage", "Student loan", or "Vehicle loan or lease".
